# Spam Classification Model

This repository contains the necessary code to execute a spam classification model, using transfer learning from hugging face models.
The goal for this project is to:
1. Accustom myself to frameworks like pytorch lightning for tuning LLM's on my specific datasets
2. Get more underlying experience with cloud providers

To do so, this project will aim to download a model from hugging face, use lightning to train, mlflow to track the model, and use azure ml as the final end goal
for the code. As time goes on, this documentation will be updated to include and new information, datasets used, decisions in modelling, etc.
